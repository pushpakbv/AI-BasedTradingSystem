  "content": "Source: Image created by Jester AI.\n\nRPM International ( RPM 0.32% ) , recommended in both Stock Advisor and Dividend Investor , will release second-quarter earnings Thursday. In Q1, the specialty chemicals company saw record quarterly sales of $2.11 billion, and returned $82 million through dividends and buybacks for a 7.4% rise year over year (YoY). RPM has raised its dividend for 52 years in a row.\n\nChevron ( CVX +2.19% ) , the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela, popped 7% in pre-market trading following the special forces operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife over the weekend. Other big oil stocks also ticked up, with ExxonMobil ( XOM +1.80% ) gaining 3% and ConocoPhillips ( COP +3.30% ) jumping 7% overnight. Oil prices are slightly down this morning, with WTI Crude dipping 1.1% to under $57.\n\nCES, the biggest tech industry show of the year, officially opens tomorrow in Las Vegas, with AI-based technology expected to dominate proceedings. Some events will take place earlier, with Nvidia ( NVDA +1.14% ) CEO Jensen Huang due to speak at 5pm PT today, and AMD ( AMD +4.35% ) CEO Lisa Su to follow at 6:30pm.\n\nAI stocks powered U.S. equities to another double-digit gain in 2025 after a rocky start, but those returns trailed the performance of international stocks and precious metals like gold and silver. The overall bond market returned 7.1% in 2025, making it the fourth-best year for bonds of the past two decades.",
