  "title": "Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger application filed with Surface Transportation Board",
  "content": "Norfolk Southern Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. filed an application Dec. 19 with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) requesting approval to combine the two railroads.\n\n“This combination will bring together Union Pacific’s expansive Western reach and Norfolk Southern’s unparalleled access to Eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination,” said Norfolk Southern President and CEO Mark George. “It will create a cohesive freight rail solution with 50,000 route miles that connect 43 states and more than 100 ports.”\n\nThe nearly 7,000-page application provides comprehensive details about how the end-to-end combination will enhance competition and deliver broad public benefits, and includes 2,000 letters of support from stakeholders at both companies who cast votes that were 99 percent in favor of the merger.\n\n“We look forward to working with the Surface Transportation Board as it reviews our historic application to create America’s first transcontinental railroad,” said Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena. “As time and technology continue to transform how freight is delivered, our industry must keep pace and move forward, reaching underserved markets with new rail solutions and strengthening the U.S. supply chain.\n\n“Customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and our merger will make that happen,” Vena added.\n\nThe companies, which entered into a merger agreement on July 29 to create America’s first transcontinental railroad, said they expect the transaction to be completed by early 2027.\n\nThe deal would connect the United States from coast to coast, transforming 10,000 existing lanes from interline service into faster, more efficient single-line service, and moving freight more efficiently, eliminating an estimated 2,400 rail car and container handlings and 60,000 car-miles each day.\n\nAdditionally, the companies said the deal would retain competitive shipping alternatives for the three customer locations out of more than 20,000 that are served by Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern but no other carrier, and allow them to compete more effectively with long-haul trucking, converting an estimated two million truckloads of freight from road to rail annually.\n\nAll union jobs would be protected, the companies said Friday, noting that every employee with a union job at the time of the merger will continue to have one, and growth of the combined company is expected to create about 900 net new union jobs by the third year following the merger.\n\nThe deal also would further enhance competition by voluntarily creating Committed Gateway Pricing, streamlining pricing of interline moves for thousands of customer locations that otherwise may not directly benefit from the merger, the companies said.\n\nOnce completed, the merger also would provide customers with a unified digital experience, with one accountable partner for their entire rail journey, and the companies plan to invest an estimated $2.1 billion of incremental capital to support revenue and cost synergies, and expect $133 million in annual capital synergies.\n\nThe application outlines the many benefits the railroads expect to provide including enhanced railroad competition, expanded affordability and competitive options for customers in virtually every major corridor; and a stronger, more efficient national rail system.\n\nLess congestion and wear on America’s roadways is also anticipated by a seamless transcontinental railroad, and the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern combination will remove the artificial barrier that divides America’s rail system between East and West, getting freight moving in the Watershed region.\n\nThere also will be more direct and reliable access to global markets as a transcontinental railroad would provide efficient, flexible, and reliable single-line access to more than 100 ports connecting to global markets and 10 international gateways to markets in Canada and Mexico, according to the application.\n\nLikewise, the merger would further reduce emissions by removing more trucks from the road, running trains more efficiently, investing in cleaner and more efficient technologies, and providing customers with better tools to achieve their own sustainability goals, the companies said.\n\nOther customer-related benefits include faster, more efficient service, expanded service offerings, improved customer asset utilization, and streamlined pricing for interline moves.\n\nRegarding safety, the railroads said they have created a safety integration plan with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and submitted it to the STB outlining how the new company will combine best practices from each railroad to further enhance the safety benefits for all.\n\nFor example, comparing the first three quarters of 2023 to the same period in 2025, Union Pacific improved its personal injury rate by 41 percent and now leads the industry in employee safety. Norfolk Southern’s advanced technologies and industry-leading rail safety practices have improved its FRA accident rate by 45 percent over the same period, the companies say.\n\nThe companies claim this is the most thoroughly planned merger in railroad history, with the combined company expecting $133 million in annual capital synergies by leveraging the combined network and fleet more efficiently.\n\nThe transaction remains subject to STB review and approval within its statutory timeline and will be subject to continuing STB oversight post-closure.\n\nThe Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern application to the STB is available for public review on its website .",
