  "content": "I have a New Year's tradition. It doesn't involve fireworks or eating certain foods. Instead, in the first week of January, I identify my top dividend stocks to buy and hold for the new year.\n\nMany of the stocks on this year's list are repeats from 2025, but there are also a few new entrants. Without further ado, here are my 26 top dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2026.\n\nLet's start with the Dividend Kings , an elite group of stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. I like three members of the dividend royalty for 2026:\n\nPharmaceutical company with multiple blockbuster drugs\n\n2. The Coca-Cola Company ( KO 1.13% )\n\nMultinational beverage maker with 30 billion-dollar brands\n\nLarge retailer with stores in the U.S. and other countries\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nI especially like AbbVie's story. The major drugmaker faced a significant patent cliff with its longtime best-selling drug, Humira, losing U.S. patent exclusivity in early 2023. However, AbbVie has roared back. I view it as one of the best healthcare stocks on the market for income investors.\n\nThe U.S. government exempts certain types of companies from federal income taxes if they return at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders as dividends. Two stocks that fit the bill rank among my favorites for the new year:\n\n4. Ares Capital ( ARCC +1.04% )\n\nLeading publicly traded business development company (BDC)\n\nLarge real estate investment trust (REIT)\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nRealty Income could be especially popular with investors. In addition to a juicy yield, the REIT pays its dividends on a monthly basis. And Realty Income has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years.\n\nI doubt anyone will buy the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks for their dividends, although several members of the group pay relatively small dividends. However, buying these stocks for their growth prospects is another story. Three of my top Mag7 dividend stocks are:\n\n6. Alphabet ( GOOG +0.48% ) ( GOOGL +0.69% )\n\nSearch engine leader and cloud services provider\n\nConsumer technology giant that makes iPhones, Macs, and other products\n\nSoftware maker and cloud services provider\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nI'm especially bullish about Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2026. It checks off nearly every box in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena, with a top-three cloud platform, a leading large language model (LLM) , and AI chips that are gaining market momentum.\n\nEnergy stocks have long been favorites among income investors for their dependable, high dividend yields. These four energy stocks look especially promising, in my view:\n\nLarge multinational oil and gas company\n\nMidstream energy company and natural gas utility\n\n11. Energy Transfer ( ET +0.61% )\n\n12. Enterprise Products Partners ( EPD +0.31% )\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nEnbridge is perhaps the most intriguing stock in this group. Its pipelines transport 30% of the crude oil transported in North America and roughly one-fifth of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. However, the company is also the largest natural gas utility in North America. Enbridge has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years.\n\nUtility stocks typically pay attractive dividends and can be safe havens during turbulent times. I like several utility stocks for 2026, with these seven especially standing out:\n\n13. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners ( BIP 1.27% )\n\nInfrastructure company with assets including utilities\n\n14. Brookfield Infrastructure Corp ( BIPC 0.26% )\n\nInfrastructure company with assets including utilities\n\n15. Brookfield Renewable Partners ( BEP +3.56% )\n\n16. Brookfield Renewable Corp ( BEPC +3.91% )\n\n17. Clearway Energy ( CWEN +1.86% )\n\n18. Dominion Energy ( D +1.11% )\n\nUtility company serving Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina\n\nUtility company serving Kansas and Missouri\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nYou probably noticed that \"Brookfield\" was mentioned four times. Brookfield Renewable and Brookfield Infrastructure each have two listed stocks: one for their limited partnerships (LPs) and one for their corporate entities. These companies are siblings sharing the same parent, Brookfield Asset Management ( BAM +1.95% ) .\n\nWhat's better than a solid dividend? A solid dividend plus an attractive valuation. These six stocks check off both boxes:\n\nPharmaceutical company with multiple blockbuster drugs\n\n21. Prudential Financial ( PRU +0.79% )\n\nLarge financial services company\n\n22. UnitedHealth Group ( UNH +1.91% )\n\nLarge health insurer and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)\n\n23. United Parcel Service ( UPS +1.85% )\n\n25. Verizon Communications ( VZ 0.52% )",
